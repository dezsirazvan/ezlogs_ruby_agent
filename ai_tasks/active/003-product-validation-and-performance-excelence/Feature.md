Task 003: Production Validation & Performance Excellence
After successful integration and optimization, we need to validate that EzlogsRubyAgent truly delivers on its promise to be "the world's most elegant Rails event tracking gem" with enterprise-grade performance and reliability.
ðŸŽ¯ Mission
Validate Production Readiness

Performance Excellence: Sub-1ms overhead, handles 20k+ events/second
Memory Efficiency: < 50MB for 100k events, zero memory leaks
Bulletproof Reliability: Never crashes host application, graceful degradation
Developer Experience: Zero-config perfection, rich debugging, clear errors

Core Validation Areas

Event Flow Accuracy: Every event type captured with perfect correlation
Performance Benchmarks: Meet or exceed all performance targets
Security Validation: PII protection works flawlessly
Error Handling: Graceful failure in all edge cases
Memory Management: Efficient resource usage under load

ðŸš€ What Success Looks Like
Perfect Zero-Config Experience
ruby# Add to Gemfile
gem 'ezlogs_ruby_agent'

# Single line configuration
EzlogsRubyAgent.configure { |c| c.service_name = "my-app" }

# Immediately captures EVERYTHING perfectly:
# âœ… HTTP requests with full context and timing
# âœ… Database changes correlated to requests
# âœ… Background jobs with perfect correlation
# âœ… Custom events with same beautiful schema
# âœ… Zero performance impact on host app
# âœ… Automatic PII protection
# âœ… Rich debugging in development
Universal Event Perfection
Every event should use the same beautiful, consistent schema:
ruby# HTTP Request Event
{
  event_id: "evt_abc123",
  timestamp: "2025-06-20T23:00:00Z",
  event_type: "http.request",
  action: "GET /users/123",
  actor: { type: "user", id: "456", email: "user@example.com" },
  subject: { type: "user", id: "123" },
  correlation: {
    correlation_id: "flow_user_profile_view_789",
    flow_id: "flow_user_profile_view_789",
    session_id: "sess_abc123",
    request_id: "req_xyz789"
  },
  metadata: { 
    status: 200, 
    duration: 0.150, 
    ip: "1.2.3.4",
    method: "GET",
    path: "/users/123"
  },
  platform: { 
    service: "my-app", 
    environment: "production",
    agent_version: "0.1.19",
    ruby_version: "3.3.5"
  }
}

# Database Change Event (same correlation!)
{
  event_id: "evt_def456",
  timestamp: "2025-06-20T23:00:00.150Z", 
  event_type: "data.change",
  action: "user.updated",
  actor: { type: "user", id: "456" },
  subject: { type: "user", id: "123" },
  correlation: {
    correlation_id: "flow_user_profile_view_789",    # Same flow!
    flow_id: "flow_user_profile_view_789",
    session_id: "sess_abc123",                       # Same session!
    request_id: "req_xyz789",                        # Same request!
    parent_event_id: "evt_abc123"                    # Linked to HTTP event!
  },
  metadata: { 
    action: "update",
    model: "user",
    changes: { email: ["old@example.com", "new@example.com"] },
    validation_errors: []
  },
  platform: { service: "my-app", environment: "production" }
}
