# Task 002: Perfect Integration & Performance Optimization

We have excellent foundational classes (UniversalEvent, EventProcessor, DeliveryEngine) but need to integrate them seamlessly with existing trackers and optimize for production performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

### Perfect Integration
- **Seamless Tracker Integration**: Update all trackers (HTTP, ActiveRecord, Jobs) to use UniversalEvent schema
- **Correlation Flow Management**: Implement proper correlation across all components
- **Rails Integration**: Make everything work together beautifully in Rails
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing APIs still work perfectly

### Performance Excellence
- **Memory Optimization**: Minimize object allocations and memory usage
- **Thread Safety**: Ensure all components are bulletproof under concurrent load
- **Connection Management**: Optimize TCP connections and reduce overhead
- **Batch Processing**: Implement efficient event batching and compression

### Developer Experience
- **Rich Debugging**: Add comprehensive debugging and inspection tools
- **Error Handling**: Perfect error messages and graceful degradation
- **Configuration Validation**: Clear feedback for configuration issues
- **Testing Helpers**: Built-in test utilities for developers

## ðŸš€ What Success Looks Like

### Zero-Config Perfection
```ruby
# This should work flawlessly with ZERO additional configuration
gem 'ezlogs_ruby_agent'

EzlogsRubyAgent.configure do |config|
  config.service_name = "my-awesome-app"
end

# Immediately captures:
# âœ… Every HTTP request with full correlation
# âœ… Every database change linked to requests
# âœ… Every background job with perfect context
# âœ… Custom events with same schema
# âœ… Perfect correlation across all events
Universal Event Flow
Every event type should use the same beautiful schema:
ruby# HTTP Request Event
{
  event_id: "evt_abc123",
  event_type: "http.request",
  action: "GET /users/123",
  actor: { type: "user", id: "456" },
  subject: { type: "user", id: "123" },
  correlation: {
    flow_id: "user_profile_view_789",
    session_id: "sess_abc123",
    request_id: "req_xyz789"
  },
  metadata: { status: 200, duration: 0.150, ip: "1.2.3.4" },
  platform: { service: "my-app", environment: "production" }
}

# Database Change Event (same correlation!)
{
  event_id: "evt_def456", 
  event_type: "data.change",
  action: "user.updated",
  actor: { type: "user", id: "456" },
  subject: { type: "user", id: "123" },
  correlation: {
    flow_id: "user_profile_view_789",    # Same flow!
    session_id: "sess_abc123",           # Same session!
    request_id: "req_xyz789",            # Same request!
    parent_event_id: "evt_abc123"        # Linked to HTTP event!
  },
  metadata: { changes: { email: ["old@example.com", "new@example.com"] } }
}
Perfect Correlation
Events should be automatically linked across components:

HTTP request triggers database change
Database change triggers background job
Background job sends email
All events share same flow_id and correlation chain

ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements
Integration Tasks

 Update HttpTracker to use UniversalEvent and proper correlation
 Update CallbacksTracker to inherit correlation from request context
 Update JobTrackers to maintain correlation across async boundaries
 Implement CorrelationManager for thread-safe correlation tracking
 Update EventWriter to use new EventProcessor and DeliveryEngine

Performance Tasks

 Memory Pool: Implement object pooling for frequently created objects
 Batch Optimization: Improve event batching and compression
 Connection Reuse: Optimize TCP connection lifecycle
 Thread Management: Ensure proper thread cleanup and resource management
 Async Processing: Non-blocking event processing pipeline

Developer Experience Tasks

 Debug Mode: Rich debugging showing event flow and correlation
 Test Helpers: Built-in helpers for testing event capture
 Error Messages: Clear, actionable error messages
 Configuration Validation: Helpful validation with suggestions
 Performance Monitoring: Built-in performance metrics

âœ¨ Key Improvements Needed
1. Correlation Management
Implement a CorrelationManager that handles context across threads:
rubyclass CorrelationManager
  def self.start_flow(type, entity_id)
    # Create new flow context
  end
  
  def self.inherit_context(parent_context)
    # Inherit correlation from parent
  end
  
  def self.current_context
    # Get current thread context
  end
end
2. Tracker Integration
Update all trackers to use UniversalEvent:
ruby# In HttpTracker
event = UniversalEvent.new(
  event_type: "http.request",
  action: "#{method} #{path}",
  actor: extract_actor(env),
  subject: extract_subject(env),
  metadata: extract_metadata(env, response)
)

# In CallbacksTracker  
event = UniversalEvent.new(
  event_type: "data.change",
  action: "#{model}.#{operation}",
  actor: current_actor,
  subject: { type: model, id: record.id },
  metadata: { changes: changes }
)
3. Performance Optimization
Add memory and performance optimizations:
rubyclass EventPool
  # Object pooling for events
end

class BatchProcessor
  # Efficient batching with compression
end

class ConnectionManager
  # Optimized connection lifecycle
end
4. Developer Tools
Add rich debugging and testing tools:
ruby# Debug mode
EzlogsRubyAgent.debug_mode = true  # Shows all events in console

# Test helpers
RSpec.describe "User flow" do
  it "tracks complete user journey" do
    EzlogsRubyAgent.test_mode do
      # Perform actions
      events = EzlogsRubyAgent.captured_events
      expect(events).to have_correlation_flow
    end
  end
end
