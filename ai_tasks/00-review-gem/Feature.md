# Task: Transform EZLogs Ruby Agent to Production Excellence

We have a solid foundation but need to elevate it to world-class quality. Your mission is to transform this into the most elegant, powerful, and reliable Rails event tracking gem ever built.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

### Code Excellence
- **Idiomatic Ruby**: Beautiful, readable code that makes developers smile
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns, easy to extend
- **Performance Optimized**: Sub-1ms overhead, handles high traffic effortlessly  
- **Security Hardened**: Built-in PII protection, bulletproof error handling
- **Test Coverage**: 100% coverage with meaningful, fast tests

### Developer Experience  
- **Zero-Config Magic**: Works perfectly out of the box
- **Infinite Flexibility**: Can be customized for any use case
- **Rich Debugging**: Easy to understand what's happening
- **Clear Documentation**: Examples and guides that actually help
- **Rails Native**: Feels like a natural part of Rails

### Production Ready
- **Bulletproof Reliability**: Never crashes or affects host application
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues working even when things fail
- **Smart Defaults**: Secure, performant defaults for everything
- **Monitoring Ready**: Built-in health checks and metrics
- **Scale Ready**: Handles enterprise-level traffic

## ðŸš€ What Success Looks Like

### Perfect Setup Experience
```ruby
# Add to Gemfile
gem 'ezlogs_ruby_agent'

# Single line configuration  
EzlogsRubyAgent.configure { |c| c.service_name = "my-app" }

# Immediately works perfectly:
# âœ… HTTP requests tracked with full context
# âœ… Database changes correlated to requests  
# âœ… Background jobs linked to triggers
# âœ… Custom events easy to add
# âœ… Zero performance impact
# âœ… Automatic PII protection
Universal Event Collection
Every Rails event type captured with rich context:

HTTP requests (routes, params, responses, timing)
Database operations (creates, updates, deletes, queries)
Background jobs (Sidekiq, ActiveJob with arguments and results)
Custom business events (user actions, state changes)
External API calls (requests, responses, errors)
Real-time correlation across all components

Intelligent Correlation
Events automatically linked to tell complete stories:

Request flows: HTTP â†’ Database â†’ Background Job â†’ Email
User journeys: Signup â†’ Verification â†’ Onboarding â†’ Purchase
Business processes: Order â†’ Payment â†’ Fulfillment â†’ Delivery
Error chains: Failure â†’ Retry â†’ Escalation â†’ Resolution

ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements
Architecture Standards

Thread-safe operations throughout
Non-blocking I/O for all network operations
Smart buffering and batching for efficiency
Circuit breaker patterns for resilience
Clean dependency injection for testability

Performance Targets

Event Creation: < 1ms for 95th percentile
Memory Usage: < 5KB per event serialized
Throughput: > 10,000 events/second sustained
Host App Impact: < 1% additional CPU/memory

Security Requirements

Automatic PII detection and redaction
Configurable field sanitization
Payload size limits to prevent DoS
Secure random ID generation
No sensitive data logged by default

âœ¨ Key Improvements Needed
1. Universal Event Schema
Current events are inconsistent. Create one beautiful schema that works for everything:
ruby{
  event_id: "evt_abc123",
  timestamp: "2025-01-21T10:30:00Z",
  event_type: "user.action",
  action: "profile.updated",
  actor: { type: "user", id: "123", email: "john@example.com" },
  subject: { type: "profile", id: "456" },
  correlation: {
    flow_id: "user_onboarding_123",
    session_id: "sess_abc123", 
    request_id: "req_abc123"
  },
  metadata: { changes: {...}, duration: 0.150 },
  platform: { service: "my-app", environment: "production" }
}
2. Smart Configuration System
Replace basic configuration with an elegant DSL:
rubyEzlogsRubyAgent.configure do |config|
  config.service_name = "my-awesome-app"
  
  # What to collect (smart defaults)
  config.collect.http_requests = true
  config.collect.database_changes = true  
  config.collect.background_jobs = true
  
  # Security (automatic protection)
  config.security.sanitize_fields = ["password", "ssn", "token"]
  config.security.auto_detect_pii = true
  config.security.max_payload_size = 64.kilobytes
  
  # Performance (optimized defaults)
  config.performance.sample_rate = 0.1
  config.performance.buffer_size = 10_000
  config.performance.batch_size = 1000
  config.performance.flush_interval = 30.seconds
end
3. Production-Grade Error Handling

Exponential backoff retry for network failures
Graceful fallback to local file storage
Circuit breaker for persistent failures
Comprehensive logging without spam
Health monitoring and self-diagnostics

4. Advanced Correlation Engine

Automatic flow detection for common patterns
Session and user tracking across requests
Business process correlation (signup, checkout, support)
Parent-child event relationships
Cross-service correlation support

5. Developer Experience Tools

Rich debugging mode showing all captured events
Test helpers for validation
Performance profiling tools
Configuration validation with helpful errors
Documentation with realistic examples
